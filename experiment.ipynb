Additionally, oral health can also have\\nsignificant impact on mental health and quality of life.\\nOral Health has not been getting the right kind of impetus\\nas it deserves, however during past two years, the focus\\nis shifting, and healthy oral cavity has come to be realized\\nas the nidus for overall health once again.\\nClove Dental envisions a goal of reducing Dental\\nHealth disparities, ensuring equity in Dental treatment\\nthereby improving overall Dental Health in India. Clove\\nDental has been working towards improvement of\\nDentistry in India with many new techniques and\\ntechnologies being adopted that has transformed the\\nway, the dental practices are being managed. Additionally,\\nClove Dental as the largest Dental chain in the country,\\nhas worked towards a more holistic and prevention and\\nminimally invasive approach to dental care, thereby\\nincreasing the acceptance and awareness across the\\ncountry.

Over time, this shall\\nunfold many more uses of these techniques, in many\\nother areas which are as yet unheard of.\\nDENTAL ALIGNERS\\nDental Aligners are a type of orthodontic appliance that\\nis used to straighten teeth and correct misalignment.\\nThey are made of clear, thin plastic and are designed to\\nfit snugly over the teeth. Aligners are being used currently\\nto correct gaps between teeth, straightening crooked or\\nmisaligned teeth, improving the overall bite alignment\\nand treating mild to moderate cases of malocclusion.\\nAccording to the American Association of Orthodontists,\\nthe number of patients treated with clear aligners in the\\nUnited States has increased significantly in recent years.\\nIn 2018, approximately 1.4 million patients in the United\\nStates were treated with clear aligners, and this number\\nis likely to grow in the intervening years. The use of\\naligners in India will continue to grow in the coming\\nyears as more patients become aware of the benefits of\\nthis treatment option.\\nAs technology continues to improve, Aligners are\\npoised to become even more effective and comfortable.\\nIt is highly likely that aligners will be used in the future\\nto treat additional conditions beyond dental alignment\\nissues. Aligners have been considered for the treatment\\nof Sleep Apnoea, helping to reposition the jaw and\\ntongue, which can improve airflow. Also its potential to\\nbe used as treatment of snoring by repositioning of the\\ntongue and jaw has been considered in the recent past.\\nIts widespread future usage to treat stress induced\\nbruxism as night guards, TMJ disorders have shown a\\npromising future. Usage of aligners as a reservoir of\\nSaliva for the management of Dry Mouth symptoms is\\nanother unexplored avenue. Its modification as a\\ncosmetic appliance to carry the teeth whitening agent,\\nexpands its potential with more than a reason of just\\nteeth alignment.

This\\nis in sync with Tele-ICU concept working on ‘spoke\\nand hub’ mechanism.\\nDENTAL IMPLANTS\\nLike aligners, Dental Implants have seen widespread use\\nworldwide and are considered a safe and effective\\ntreatment option for tooth loss. According to the\\nInternational Association for Dental Research, dental\\nimplants have a success rate of 95-98% in patients with\\ngood oral health, and this success rate has likely\\ncontributed to their increasing use.

They are\\nartificial tooth roots that are placed into the jawbone\\nand used to support a replacement tooth or teeth, such\\nas a crown, bridge, or denture, they can improve a\\nperson’s ability to chew and speak properly. By replacing\\nthe root of the missing tooth, it stimulates the bone and\\narrests further bone loss. It can be potentially used for\\nimproving the appearance of a person’s smile, which\\nhas a positive effect on self-esteem and confidence while\\nalso preserving the integrity of the jawbone.\\nHowever, its potential for treatment of jawbone due\\nto periodontal (gum) disease or tooth loss is yet to be\\nfully realized. Its role towards stimulating the jawbone\\nand promoting new bone growth, thereby restoring and\\nmaintaining the shape, strength and function of the jaw,\\nprovides a broader futuristic approach for extensive\\nresearch. In addition to being used for tooth replacement,\\ndental implants will also find usage in a number of medical\\napplications. One example of this is in the field of\\nOrthopaedic surgery, where dental implants have been\\nused to anchor prosthetic joints such as knees and hips.\\nDental implants have also been used in the field of\\ncraniofacial surgery, where they can be used to anchor\\nprosthesis like eye, ear or finger and also to stabilize facial\\nbones following trauma or surgery. They have also been\\nused in the field of Neurology to anchor brain sensors in\\nplace for long-term monitoring of brain activity. It is\\npossible that dental implants of future will be used as a\\nreservoir to carry nerve conductor hormones and other\\ndepot medicines.  One potential approach for delivering\\nthese medications to the bone will be through the use of\\nimplantable drug delivery systems, such as dental\\nimplants.

In dentistry, CAD/CAM\\nsystems are used to create a digital model of a patient’s\\nteeth, which can then be used to design and fabricate a\\nvariety of dental prosthesis, including crowns, bridges,\\nand veneers.

For\\nexample, custom-designed dental prosthetics that are\\ntailored to the unique anatomy of each patient could\\nbecome more widely available.
